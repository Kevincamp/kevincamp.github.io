# Swift Best Practices in 2025

As we move further into 2025, Swift continues to evolve with new patterns and best practices. After years of Swift development, I'd like to share some key practices that have proven invaluable in modern iOS development.

## 1. Modern Property Wrappers

Property wrappers have become increasingly important for clean, maintainable code:

{% highlight swift %}
@propertyWrapper
struct Validated<T> {
private var value: T
private let validator: (T) -> Bool

    var wrappedValue: T {
        get { value }
        set {
            guard validator(newValue) else {
                fatalError("Validation failed")
            }
            value = newValue
        }
    }

    init(wrappedValue: T, validator: @escaping (T) -> Bool) {
        self.validator = validator
        guard validator(wrappedValue) else {
            fatalError("Initial value validation failed")
        }
        self.value = wrappedValue
    }

}
{% endhighlight %}

## 2. Protocol-Oriented Programming

Swift's protocol-oriented approach has matured significantly:

{% highlight swift %}
protocol NetworkingService {
func fetch<T: Decodable>(\_ endpoint: Endpoint) async throws -> T
}

// Modern implementation using async/await
final class APIService: NetworkingService {
func fetch<T: Decodable>(\_ endpoint: Endpoint) async throws -> T {
let (data, response) = try await URLSession.shared.data(for: endpoint.urlRequest)
guard let httpResponse = response as? HTTPURLResponse,
(200...299).contains(httpResponse.statusCode) else {
throw NetworkError.invalidResponse
}
return try JSONDecoder().decode(T.self, from: data)
}
}
{% endhighlight %}

## 3. Memory Management

Modern Swift applications require careful attention to memory management:

{% highlight swift %}
final class ViewModel {
private weak var delegate: ViewModelDelegate?
private var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()

    init(delegate: ViewModelDelegate) {
        self.delegate = delegate
        setupBindings()
    }

    private func setupBindings() {
        $somePublisher
            .sink { [weak self] value in
                self?.handleUpdate(value)
            }
            .store(in: &cancellables)
    }

}
{% endhighlight %}

These practices represent the current state of Swift development in 2025. In future posts, I'll dive deeper into each of these topics and explore more advanced patterns and techniques.

Remember: The best code is not just about following patterns - it's about writing clear, maintainable, and efficient solutions that solve real problems.

Stay tuned for more Swift development insights!
